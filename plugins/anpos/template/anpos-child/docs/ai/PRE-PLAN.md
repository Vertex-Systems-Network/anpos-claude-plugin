# AI-Native Pre-Plan

> **Template.** Every `TBD` is a placeholder. In the canonical source this file stays a template; in a child project the planner fills it during START-HERE Stage 7.

This file is the living pre-implementation decomposition document. The AI must replace template placeholders with project-specific evidence before large-scale implementation. Cite research as `EVID-*` IDs from `config/research/evidence-registry.json`.

## 1. Product Objective

- What outcome is the system intended to create?
- Who is it for?
- What problem is it solving?

## 2. Scope

### In scope

- TBD

### Out of scope / non-goals

- TBD

## 3. Current Repository Reality

- Existing implementation: TBD
- Existing architecture: TBD
- Existing tests/build status: TBD
- Existing deployments/environments: TBD
- Known incomplete or temporary work: TBD

## 4. Primary Actors and Workflows

- TBD

## 5. Validated Requirements

Use stable `REQ-*` IDs; each one also gets a link in `config/traceability/requirements-traceability.json`.

| ID | Requirement | Source / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-001 | TBD | TBD |

## 6. Assumptions Still Requiring Validation

- TBD

### Product hypotheses (REQ-84–86)

| Hypothesis | How it will be validated | KPI (if measurable) |
|---|---|---|
| TBD | TBD | TBD |

## 6a. Evidence-Driven Changes to the Original Idea

- Recommended additions: TBD
- Recommended removals / simplifications: TBD
- Competitive / market-driven requirements: TBD
- Differentiators: TBD

## 7. Constraints and Risks

- TBD

## 8. Approved Technology Decisions

- Frontend: TBD
- Backend: TBD
- Data: TBD
- Infrastructure: TBD
- Consent status: pending

## 9. Options Bank Summary

Record selected, rejected, and deferred option IDs from `config/ai/options-bank.json`.

- Selected: TBD
- Rejected: TBD
- Deferred: TBD

## 10. Proposed Modules

Record canonical module IDs from `config/ai/modules-bank.json`.

- TBD

For each module define its objective, boundaries, dependencies, attached option IDs, acceptance criteria, and expected QA/security coverage in the Modules Bank.

## 11. Phase / Milestone Strategy

Convert the project into outcome-oriented phases, then map modules and small work units to them.

- Phase 1: TBD
- Phase 2: TBD

Avoid giant phases that cannot be completed or verified incrementally.

### Work units

Mirror of `config/ai/execution-plan.json` `work_units`; that file is canonical.

| ID | Phase | Module | Requirements | Depends on | Priority | Allowed paths | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WU-TBD | PHASE-TBD | MOD-TBD | REQ-TBD | — | 100 | TBD | TBD |

## 12. Dependency and Critical-Path Notes

- TBD

## 13. QA Strategy

- TBD

## 14. Security Strategy

- TBD

## 15. Deployment / Operations Implications

- TBD

## 16. Unresolved Human Decisions

- TBD

## 17. Plan Approval

- Plan status (`config/ai/execution-plan.json` `plan_status`): draft
- Approval consent ID (`plan_approval_ref`): TBD
- Approved by / at: TBD

## 18. Execution Readiness

Planning (Stage 7) ends at plan approval. These items are confirmed later, before implementation at scale (after Stage 9 technology consent):

- [ ] validated project objective exists
- [ ] repository reality has been reconciled
- [ ] system design is coherent
- [ ] technology stack has required consent
- [ ] options bank is populated sufficiently for known capabilities
- [ ] modules bank is populated with stable module IDs
- [ ] module-option attachments are defined
- [ ] phases/milestones are mapped to modules
- [ ] modules are decomposed into small verifiable work units
- [ ] dependencies and blockers are visible
- [ ] acceptance criteria and required checks exist
- [ ] project state identifies a valid resume point
- [ ] the plan is approved (`plan_status: approved`) and slots were generated from it
