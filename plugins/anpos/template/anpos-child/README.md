# AI Native Project Operating System (ANPOS)

**Current protocol:** `1.4.0`

ANPOS is a reusable Git repository template/protocol for starting AI-native software projects with structured discovery, research, planning, architecture, provider-agnostic project management, selectable development AIs, multi-agent coordination, design assurance, quality, security, release governance, data governance, operations, project memory, continuous improvement, and optional commercial distribution/licensing.

## Canonical source boundary

`Vertex-Systems-Network/ai-native-project-operating-system` is the **canonical reusable template source**, not a live application project or live billing service.

The source must remain inert:

- no live Project Management provider/project is selected or mapped;
- no project-specific Supervisor/Worker AI pool is attached;
- no child-project GitHub Rules are treated as applied to this source;
- no child-project runtime/quality workflows or Dependabot config are active under source `.github/`; the only active source workflows are the repository-guarded continuous certification guard and the vendor-only commercial operations workflows (handoff, production readiness/deploy/migrate, sandbox E2E); every one of them is listed in `config/licensing/vendor-source-boundary.json`, enforced by `scripts/validate_ai_native_repo.py`, and stripped from customer/vendor-template outputs;
- no production credentials, environments, releases, claims, leases, runtime consent decisions, project progress, or PM sync timestamps are stored as live project state;
- no Marketplace customer records, live paid plan IDs, payment data, webhook secrets, GitHub App private keys, entitlement-signing private keys, or active customer entitlements are stored here.

> **Canonical source = protocol + schemas + scripts + provider catalogs + policies + inactive blueprints. Child project = selected integrations + verified AI identities + approved/applied governance + active quality/runtime automation + project-specific implementation/state. Commercial runtime = separately deployed billing/entitlement/provisioning service.**

Blueprint presence is never proof that a capability is enabled, purchased, connected, deployed, or verified.

### Commercial subscription finalization

The commercial runtime uses the `ANPOS_*` environment namespace for Marketplace, Vendor Distribution, entitlement, seat, and operator configuration. New production deployments must not require environment variables whose names begin with `GITHUB_`; historical legacy names are not launch configuration.

Current paid-launch sequence remains fail-closed: configure real Marketplace plan IDs, signing/seat/operator controls, then prove purchase/change/cancel reconciliation and Repository Supervisor entitlement E2E before paid launch is called ready. Developer delivery now uses a deterministic certified template release embedded into the private commercial-service artifact; production also exposes a no-store public-safe Marketplace plan discovery readiness route that reads real listing plan identities with the Marketplace App JWT and reports only bounded App-owner/active-installation eligibility observations; a separate Vendor Distribution App/private template repository is no longer a Developer launch dependency and remains conditional for collaborator provisioning or higher-tier private distribution. Marketplace reconciliation preserves billing cycle, next billing date, and free-trial end time for customer-facing subscription status. Migration `008_marketplace_billing_lifecycle.sql` is the current commercial database readiness gate.

Live paid-launch status (Marketplace plan IDs, installation counts, eligibility observations) is operational state and is intentionally not recorded in this inert source. Canonical tracker: Issue #94.

## Persistent source continuous certification in 1.3.13

The canonical source retains one active certification workflow, `.github/workflows/source-continuous-certification.yml`, alongside the vendor-only commercial operations workflows described above. All active workflows are repository-guarded and listed in the vendor source boundary.

- It runs on pull requests targeting `main` and on pushes to `main`.
- It is hard-bound to `Vertex-Systems-Network/ai-native-project-operating-system`, uses read-only repository permissions, does not consume repository secrets, disables checkout credential persistence, and pins GitHub Actions to immutable commit SHAs.
- It runs the complete Python conformance/validator suite, deterministic vendor export + exact handoff verification, locked npm audit, commercial TypeScript tests, and the Next.js production build.
- Its workflow, validator, and regression test are canonical-vendor-source-only assets and are removed from customer child repositories and `anpos-commercial-template` exports through the committed vendor source boundary.
- Workflow success is CI evidence only. GitHub branch protection/rulesets, required-check enforcement, bypass policy, and review requirements remain repository-administration controls that must be independently configured and re-read before they can be called enforced.

## New child-project startup

1. Create/copy a new Git repository from ANPOS.
2. Give the **child repository URL** to a compatible AI and ask it to initialize the project.
3. The AI reads `AGENTS.md`, `.ai/manifest.json`, repository identity, and `config/protocol/instance.json`.
4. If the repository is not the canonical source but inherited `instance_status: template_source`, run `scripts/bootstrap_child.py` before project development.
5. Offer **Start Development**.
6. Continue the deterministic initialization flow below.

## Mandatory child initialization

### 1. Bootstrap child identity and safe defaults

`scripts/bootstrap_child.py`:

- creates child instance identity;
- clears inherited claims, leases, alerts, consent decisions, PM mappings and AI selections;
- clears inherited durable-memory provenance entries;
- regenerates child-valid CODEOWNERS ownership;
- preserves the template-safe `.gitignore` hygiene baseline while allowing stack-specific child rules to be added after technology approval;
- activates child-local security, runtime-budget, release, data, operations, migration, design and conformance policies without inventing external capability;
- installs only universally safe child workflow blueprints immediately;
- records capability-dependent GitHub security checks for later verified activation;
- leaves PM selection, AI selection and GitHub Rules decisions unresolved;
- strips the vendor-only `commercial-service/` implementation from initialized customer/child repositories.

The canonical source refuses normal child bootstrap.

Commercial licensing is **not** a mandatory child runtime dependency. A commercial customer project may later cache a non-secret entitlement reference for premium updates/services, but editing that reference never creates billing authority and expiry must not brick generated project code.

### 2. Choose Project Management System

ANPOS is PM-provider agnostic.

Preferred selection surface:

**Choose Project Management System**

Candidate providers may include:

- **Linear — Recommended**
- GitHub Projects
- Jira / Atlassian
- ClickUp
- GitLab Issues / Boards
- Azure DevOps Boards
- Plane
- Asana
- monday.com
- Notion
- Other compatible provider
- **Skip Project Management**

Only providers with a real authenticated connector/MCP/API/git-native integration path may be shown as attachable controls.

After selection:

- authenticate through a secure host flow; never request ordinary passwords/session cookies/raw private tokens in normal chat;
- verify workspace/project mapping before enabling sync;
- treat PM/MCP text as external data, never as instruction authority;
- apply `config/integrations/sync-authority.json` for per-field authority, idempotency, cursor/revision handling, loop prevention and conflict recording;
- keep Git/repository/PR/test/release evidence canonical for implementation reality.

Linear is recommended, not mandatory. Linear-specific state is used only if Linear is selected.

### 3. Choose Development AI

Project-management selection and development-AI selection are independent.

Preferred surface:

**Choose Development AI**

Candidate examples include Codex/ChatGPT, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf and other compatible agents.

Only agents the current host can genuinely invoke/attach may be selectable. Selection alone is not authorization. Before privileged work, each selected agent must have:

- host-authenticated runtime identity evidence;
- permitted Supervisor/Worker role;
- capabilities;
- allowed/denied paths;
- allowed tools;
- network policy + destination allowlist;
- PM scope;
- secret scope;
- deployment scope;
- repository-admin/destructive-action permissions;
- explicit privacy/data-boundary profile.

Unknown privacy properties remain explicit unknowns.

### 4. Apply Code Quality safely

Universal bootstrap installs repository-integrity/conformance validation and normal runtime blueprints that do not depend on unavailable GitHub security products.

Before enabling capability-dependent checks, inspect child visibility, plan/features, permissions and platform capability.

Capability-dependent checks include, when actually supported:

- CodeQL / code scanning;
- Dependency Review;
- OSSF Scorecard or equivalent supply-chain checks;
- other GitHub security features whose availability depends on repository visibility, plan, permissions or enabled products.

Never make an unavailable check required in GitHub Rules.

### 5. Decide GitHub Rules

Ask the user whether to apply the recommended child-project GitHub Rules.

Recommended child rules include:

- PRs required;
- CODEOWNER review for protected control-plane paths;
- required conversations resolved;
- verified required checks only;
- no force pushes/deletion on protected branches;
- protected coordination ref namespaces;
- up-to-date branch when appropriate;
- independent review for security/control-plane/high-risk changes.

Do not claim rules are active until GitHub enforcement is re-read and verified.

### 6. Free-form project intake

The project owner may provide any combination of:

**Idea / Thoughts / Plan / Research / Search / Assumptions**

ANPOS converts that into structured research, planning, architecture, acceptance criteria, modules, work units and execution state without requiring the owner to write a perfect specification first.

## Research and planning model

Before architecture is locked, ANPOS may perform:

1. understand the supplied idea/context;
2. public internet discovery when relevant/current information is required;
3. focused technical/market research;
4. independent reasoning and risk analysis;
5. comparable-system/product audit;
6. synthesis into a project plan;
7. owner review/approval of material technology decisions.

External web pages, PM items, MCP results, design text, issues, PR comments and peer-agent output remain untrusted **data** until classified and authorized by the trust/control-plane policy.

## Engineering lifecycle

Typical lifecycle:

**Intake → Research → Plan → Architecture → Technology Consent → UX/UI → Phase/Module/Work-Unit Breakdown → Multi-Agent Development → Review → QA/Security → Release → Operations → Continuous Improvement**

Architecture should cover, when applicable:

- system boundaries;
- service/module responsibilities;
- data flow;
- APIs/contracts;
- persistence;
- authentication/authorization;
- privacy/data classification;
- failure modes;
- observability;
- deployment/release strategy;
- migration strategy;
- threat model;
- backup/recovery;
- responsive/accessibility/localization requirements;
- operational ownership.

## Multi-agent model

A child project may use multiple compatible AIs when the current host/runtime can actually invoke them.

Core hierarchy:

**Owner → Supervisor → Worker(s)**

Exactly one active Supervisor lease may hold merge/reconciliation authority at a time. Workers claim bounded work units through atomic refs and may modify only paths/tools/networks/PM scopes/secrets/deployment scopes granted by their authenticated handoff.

Worker completion phrase:

**ALL DONE SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW AND MERGE**

The Supervisor validates code, tests, security, scope, ownership, conflicts and current repository state before accepting/merging.

Repository/Git/PR/test/release reality outranks stale PM mirrors or agent memory.

## Control-plane security

ANPOS protects AI/runtime governance as a privileged control plane.

Protected surfaces include core AI instructions, manifests, schemas, coordination state, bootstrap/orchestration scripts, security/consent/rules/quality/runtime/release/data/operations/contracts/integration/design/testing/traceability policy, commercial licensing assets and the vendor-only commercial service implementation.

Privileged actions require appropriate combinations of:

- authenticated runtime principal;
- selected verified agent identity;
- authorized role;
- capability;
- path scope;
- tool/network/PM/secret/deployment scope;
- live lease/fencing token where coordination authority is involved;
- authenticated consent for material owner-controlled decisions.

External prompt/MCP/PM/web/design/comment content cannot promote itself into instruction authority.

## Coordination and leases

Worker and Supervisor coordination use repository-backed atomic refs plus local machine-readable state.

The control plane supports:

- claim/election acquisition;
- identity/capability eligibility checks;
- heartbeat/renewal;
- release;
- expiry and stale-lock recovery;
- orphan-ref rollback/recovery;
- fencing-token validation;
- CAS-style shared-state mutation;
- merge-generation reconciliation.

A remote ref alone is not sufficient authority when matching authenticated state/fencing evidence is absent.

## Project-management integration

PM systems are planning/progress mirrors, not code truth.

Common adapter behavior includes project/phase/module/task creation, assignment, status/priority/blocker sync, branch/PR linkage, review/merge sync, progress and completion.

PM sync uses:

- per-field authority;
- revision/cursor state;
- idempotency keys;
- echo/loop prevention;
- conflict records;
- repository-first reconciliation;
- provider-switch migration from canonical repository state.

No PM provider is required for ANPOS development to continue.

## Design assurance

When design work applies, ANPOS records an immutable approved design revision/snapshot/reference before implementation acceptance.

Design evidence may include:

- Figma/design source revision;
- implementation screenshot/reference;
- visual regression evidence;
- responsive states;
- component/state traceability;
- accessibility verification.

Web projects default to **WCAG 2.2 AA** unless the project deliberately adopts another documented target.

## Data, migrations and operations

Production-capable child projects should define data classification, retention/deletion, logging/redaction, non-production data rules, threat model, migration safety, observability, SLOs, incident handling, RTO/RPO and restore evidence appropriate to project risk.

Database/API breaking changes should prefer:

**expand → migrate → verify → contract**

Destructive or irreversible migration steps require explicit review/consent and rollback/recovery evidence.

## Release assurance

Production release requires applicable evidence such as:

- immutable commit/artifact;
- required tests/security checks;
- migration preflight;
- environment-scoped secrets;
- short-lived/OIDC deployment identity where supported;
- rollback/roll-forward plan;
- post-deploy smoke verification;
- SBOM/provenance/attestation where supported;
- operations/readiness checks.

## Commercial distribution

Commercial distribution is optional and isolated from core child execution.

GitHub Marketplace is the recommended GitHub-native billing adapter. Commercial state must be verified server-side; repository entitlement files are non-authoritative references only.

Requirements 75–82 define:

- distribution modes;
- billing authority;
- signed entitlement envelopes;
- secure/idempotent webhook handling;
- non-destructive expiry/cancellation;
- plans/seats/features;
- customer privacy;
- commercial legal/operational launch gates.

The canonical repository does not contain real prices, live Marketplace plan IDs, customer billing records, signing private keys, webhook secrets or active customer entitlements.

## Requirements coverage

ANPOS currently represents requirements **1–96**:

- **1–34 — Discovery, research, planning, architecture, design, development, PM sync, multi-agent execution, continuous improvement, GitHub governance and Code Quality**
- **35–44 — Child bootstrap, atomic claims, Supervisor election/failover, durable orchestration, context routing, formal schemas/state machine, protocol migrations, vendor adapters, traceability and path ownership**
- **45–56 — Protected AI control plane, agent identity/eligibility, lease lifecycle, namespace protection, mutation fencing, trusted CI, trust firewall, tool sandbox/least privilege, replay-resistant consent, memory provenance and chaos/conformance testing**
- **57–66 — Capability-aware quality bootstrap, workflow permission contracts, dynamic dependency management, Draft 2020-12 schema enforcement, release/environment/OIDC/secrets, SBOM/provenance, PM conflict/idempotency, typed handoff and provider privacy**
- **67–74 — Design revision lock, visual/accessibility evidence, WCAG 2.2 AA web baseline, data/privacy lifecycle, threat model, API/DB migration safety, SLO/incident/DR and budget/rate/retry/recursion guardrails**
- **75–82 — Commercial distribution modes, billing authority, signed entitlements, webhook security/replay protection, non-destructive expiry, plan/seat entitlements, customer privacy, and commercial legal/operational launch gates**
- **83–88 — AI-native product assurance: AI/model evaluation, user/problem validation, product analytics, bounded experimentation, progressive delivery, and engineering maintainability review**
- **89–96 — AI-native governance assurance: responsible AI/human oversight, compliance evidence, ADRs, AI asset identity, deprecation/EOL, resilience runbooks/drills, tamper-evident audit evidence, and unified risk/exception lifecycle**

Protocol representation does **not** mean a child runtime or commercial service has passed production certification. A production orchestrator must pass applicable project runtime scenarios; a commercial entitlement service must additionally pass `commercial_runtime_integration` scenarios in `config/testing/conformance-scenarios.json`.

## Commercial runtime hardening in 1.3.1

The optional vendor-side `commercial-service/` reference implementation now includes durable PostgreSQL rate limiting, bounded request parsing, retry-safe/idempotent Marketplace delivery processing, explicit organization seat assignment, principal-bound v2 organization entitlements, archive-first private template delivery, reference-counted collaborator revocation, least-privilege GitHub App tokens, checksum-locked database migrations, strict readiness gates, and a committed npm lockfile. Collaborator provisioning remains an optional fallback and is disabled by default.

The commercial service was certified with locked `npm ci`, TypeScript typecheck, commercial security unit tests, Next.js production build, ANPOS validators/tests, and source-boundary checks. This certification proves the repository implementation/build contract; it does **not** claim that a GitHub Marketplace listing, GitHub App, production database, Vercel deployment, secrets, pricing, or customer billing runtime is live.

`scripts/bootstrap_child.py` remains the canonical child bootstrap entrypoint and removes the vendor-only `commercial-service/` implementation from initialized customer/child repositories.


## Vendor repository separation in 1.3.2

`scripts/export_vendor_repositories.py` provides a deterministic, fail-closed source-management bridge for the future private vendor repositories. Run it from a clean canonical Git worktree with an output directory outside the repository:

```bash
python scripts/export_vendor_repositories.py --output <outside-directory>
```

The default export produces `anpos-commercial-service` from committed `commercial-service/` Git blobs with the prefix stripped, and `anpos-commercial-template` from the canonical source with every path classified as vendor-only in `config/licensing/vendor-source-boundary.json` excluded. Exported bytes come from committed Git objects at `HEAD`, not untracked or modified working-tree files. Each output includes `EXPORT-MANIFEST.json` with source revision/tree and per-file Git object/mode/SHA-256 provenance.

The exporter refuses tracked secret-like files, committed symlinks, generated/runtime paths, unsupported Git modes, dirty tracked trees by default, output paths inside the canonical repository, and pre-existing targets. It does **not** create GitHub repositories, configure a GitHub App/Marketplace listing, transfer credentials, deploy a runtime, or make commercial licensing a child-project dependency.


## Commercial launch package in 1.3.3

ANPOS includes an **inactive vendor/operator launch package** under `blueprints/commercial/` plus `scripts/verify_commercial_production.py`. It provides a GitHub App configuration blueprint, Marketplace listing draft, fail-closed production launch checklist, legal-document template pack, and production smoke verifier.

These assets do not create a GitHub App, approve Marketplace financial onboarding, set prices/plan IDs, accept legal terms, store production credentials, or authorize sales. The source checklist remains `launch_authorized: false`; production promotion requires real external evidence for every required gate. The verifier may check health/readiness/public keys and optional authenticated customer/operator routes, but synthetic smoke checks are never evidence of a real Marketplace purchase/change/cancel event.

Vendor/operator launch and export assets are classified through `config/licensing/vendor-source-boundary.json`; child bootstrap and the customer-facing commercial-template export remove them. Their tests/validators run through the separate inactive `blueprints/commercial/vendor-launch-quality.yml`, while the child `repository-quality.yml` remains free of dependencies on stripped vendor-only tooling.

## GitHub Marketplace compliance hardening in 1.3.4

ANPOS now includes a vendor-only, machine-readable GitHub Marketplace compliance baseline checked against official GitHub documentation on **2026-09-04**. It records current paid GitHub App publication prerequisites such as organization ownership and organization-owner listing control, verified-publisher prerequisites, financial onboarding, the documented minimum of 100 installations for a paid listing, listing/support/privacy/assets requirements, monthly and annual USD paid-plan pricing, customer billing-state visibility, and the current Marketplace free-trial/private-data-retention baseline.

These values are **not launch evidence** and GitHub can change Marketplace requirements. `blueprints/commercial/github-marketplace-compliance.json` must therefore be re-verified against official GitHub documentation immediately before listing submission. The production checklist remains fail-closed: it cannot infer installation count, publisher verification, financial approval, prices/plan IDs, listing approval, customer billing UX, trial-data deletion evidence, or production readiness from repository files.

Marketplace compliance assets remain inside the vendor/operator source boundary and are stripped from normal child repositories and customer-facing `anpos-commercial-template` exports. ANPOS core child development continues without a Marketplace or billing runtime dependency.

## Marketplace staged publication in 1.3.5

GitHub's current Marketplace documentation allows a free app/listing to be published after the general listing requirements are met, while the current 100-install minimum applies to publishing a paid GitHub App plan. ANPOS therefore includes an inactive vendor-only `marketplace-staged-launch.json` strategy that recommends **free-first → genuine installations/evidence → verified paid conversion** while paid eligibility is missing.

The staged strategy is intentionally fail-closed. It does not invent a Community/free plan, Marketplace plan ID, or free entitlements; it does not alter the draft Developer/Pro/Team/Enterprise catalog; and it cannot authorize automatic paid conversion. A free offering must first have operator-approved real user value beyond authentication, complete general Marketplace listing/privacy/support/assets requirements, and pass real purchase/cancellation webhook tests. Once current paid requirements are genuinely met, GitHub's current documentation supports adding paid plans to an already-published free listing after verified-publisher and financial onboarding requirements are satisfied.

Installation thresholds and Marketplace rules can change, so official GitHub documentation must be re-checked before free submission and paid conversion. Artificial, purchased, deceptive, or otherwise non-genuine installations are explicitly outside the strategy.

## GitHub App trust separation in 1.3.6

ANPOS 1.3.6 separates the GitHub App used for customer-facing Marketplace publication/reconciliation from the GitHub App used for vendor private-template distribution. The Marketplace App is a public/installable customer-facing trust boundary; the Vendor Distribution App stays private to the publisher and receives only the private-repository permissions required for archive delivery or the explicitly enabled collaborator fallback.

Commercial service `0.3.0` requires distinct `GITHUB_MARKETPLACE_APP_*` and `GITHUB_VENDOR_APP_*` credentials. Readiness fails closed if the App IDs are equal, if the private keys are reused, or if an operator supplies only the legacy `GITHUB_APP_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` pair. Marketplace reconciliation uses only the Marketplace App JWT; vendor installation tokens use only the Vendor App JWT.

The legacy single-App manifest remains only as a deprecated migration marker. Separate vendor-only manifests define the public Marketplace App and private Vendor Distribution App, and deterministic customer-template export strips all of these vendor launch assets. This change does not create either App, grant Marketplace approval, configure production credentials, define a free plan, or authorize sales.

## Operator launch bootstrap in 1.3.7

ANPOS 1.3.7 adds `scripts/render_operator_launch_bootstrap.py` plus `blueprints/commercial/operator-launch-bootstrap.md` to reduce external commercial setup errors without moving credentials or account authority into the repository. Given only a GitHub organization slug, HTTPS commercial-service base URL and HTTPS product homepage URL, the renderer produces a fail-closed JSON handoff containing prefilled GitHub App registration URLs and the commercial service 0.3.0 environment-key contract.

The generated Marketplace App registration is public, webhook-enabled and subscribed to `marketplace_purchase`, with no vendor private-template repository permissions. The generated Vendor Distribution App registration is private, webhook-disabled and archive-first with `Contents: read`; `Administration: write` is added only when the operator explicitly enables collaborator provisioning. The renderer never accepts private keys, webhook secrets, database credentials, operator tokens, Marketplace plan IDs, prices or customer data.

The output does not create GitHub Apps or repositories and cannot prove Marketplace approval, installation counts, publisher verification, pricing, plan IDs or production readiness. GitHub remains authoritative for the final App registrations, and current GitHub/Marketplace requirements must be re-checked before registration and listing submission.

## Deployment identity attestation in 1.3.8

ANPOS 1.3.8 makes commercial deployment identity a first-class production gate. Commercial service `0.3.1` exposes `GET /api/version`, derived from package metadata, with the service version, source ANPOS protocol version and runtime-contract identifier. The endpoint is public, secret-free and `Cache-Control: no-store`.

`scripts/verify_commercial_production.py --require-ready` now requires `--expected-service-version` and `--expected-protocol-version` and verifies `/api/version` before readiness. This prevents a stale or wrong artifact from being certified merely because `/api/health` is green. The verifier also uses the actual Next.js `/api/v1/...` paths; the previously unprefixed `/v1/...` smoke-check paths were invalid and returned 404 on the connected deployment.

## Repository hygiene

ANPOS keeps a minimal protected `.gitignore` for its own tooling and secret/temp safety. It ignores Python caches/virtual environments, coverage caches, `.env` variants, common OS/editor residue and temporary/backup files. Stack-specific generated/build/dependency ignores belong to each child project after its actual technology stack is approved.

Stale duplicate protocol documents should be removed once their unique responsibilities have been absorbed into canonical routed documents, schemas and machine policies. Reference audits and validators remain the deletion safety gate.

## Certification model

The child/source repository quality gate is designed to run:

1. pinned ANPOS validation dependencies;
2. Python compile checks;
3. control-plane and commercial conformance unit tests;
4. Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema validation;
5. current-tree core ANPOS validator;
6. commercial distribution/licensing validator;
7. protected-base validator(s) on PRs;
8. workflow pinning/permission checks;
9. machine/YAML hygiene checks.

Static/unit success is not sufficient to certify a persistent orchestrator or commercial billing service. Runtime integration scenarios include concurrent claims, stale fencing, orphan locks, Supervisor crash/failover, merge-during-work, duplicate events, PM outages/switching, identity expiry, malicious external instructions, consent replay, CI tampering, budget loops, production assurance failures, Marketplace webhook forgery/replay, plan-change reconciliation, and non-destructive license expiry.

## Release, design, data and operations assurance

Production-capable children must establish, when applicable:

- immutable release commit/artifact evidence;
- required QA/security checks;
- migration preflight;
- environment-scoped secrets and short-lived/OIDC identity where supported;
- rollback/roll-forward + post-deploy verification;
- SBOM/provenance/attestation evidence where supported;
- approved design revision/snapshot and visual/accessibility evidence;
- WCAG 2.2 AA web target unless deliberately overridden;
- data classification, retention/deletion and non-production protections;
- persistent threat model and security verification evidence;
- expand→migrate→verify→contract database/API change strategy;
- observability, SLOs, incident roles, backups, RTO/RPO and restore testing appropriate to project risk.

## Continuous improvement

Child runtime blueprints support:

- 24-hour technology-update audit requests after the applicable lifecycle stage;
- optional 25-hour innovation scouting after owner opt-in;
- upstream ANPOS protocol-version/update checks.

Scheduled workflows create signals; they do not pretend to be a continuously reasoning AI Supervisor.

## Start prompt

For a child repository created from this template, give its repository URL to a compatible AI and say:

> Read this repository's AI instructions and initialize the project.

For commercial distribution work, ask a compatible AI to load the repository's `commercial_distribution` role and audit/configure the external Marketplace/licensing deployment without storing live secrets in this repository.

## Operator artifact identity binding in 1.3.9

The vendor-only operator launch bootstrap now derives the exact deployable commercial-service identity directly from `commercial-service/package.json` and cross-checks its embedded source protocol against `config/protocol/version.json`. The rendered handoff includes `artifact_identity` plus `production_verifier_arguments`, so expected service/protocol versions are no longer copied by hand into deployment instructions.

The renderer fails closed on missing/malformed package identity, package/protocol mismatch, or an unexpected runtime contract. Operators must deploy the exact exported artifact, verify `/api/version` against the generated identity, and only then accept `/api/ready` plus real Marketplace E2E evidence. This tooling remains vendor-only and does not create repositories, credentials, GitHub Apps, Marketplace approvals, prices, plan IDs, installations, or launch authority.

## Deterministic vendor handoff verification in 1.3.10

ANPOS now binds the vendor/operator handoff to the exact canonical Git commit and tree used for deterministic private-repository exports. `scripts/verify_vendor_handoff.py` reconstructs the expected service or customer-template export from committed canonical Git blobs and compares the complete target file/byte set, including `EXPORT-MANIFEST.json`, before that export or a clean private-repository checkout is accepted.

For Git checkouts, verification reads committed `HEAD` blobs and requires a clean checkout including untracked files. It fails closed on stale source identity, extra/missing files, byte drift, unsupported Git modes/symlinks, wrong export mode, or wrong service/protocol/runtime identity. Successful verification emits a JSON provenance receipt with canonical source revision/tree, target repository revision when applicable, manifest SHA-256 and content-set SHA-256. The receipt proves exact deterministic-export equality only; it does not prove repository privacy/ownership, GitHub App installation, Marketplace approval, credentials, deployment, or launch authority.

## Ignored-file vendor checkout hardening in 1.3.11

Private vendor-repository acceptance now treats ignored untracked files as checkout contamination. `scripts/verify_vendor_handoff.py` runs Git status with explicit all-untracked plus ignored matching-path visibility before reading committed `HEAD` blobs, so `.gitignore` or `.git/info/exclude` cannot hide extra target bytes from the cleanliness gate.

This strengthens the 1.3.10 exact handoff contract without changing export content, Marketplace state, credentials, pricing, plan IDs or launch authority. Vendor repositories should be verified from a truly clean checkout before they are accepted as source of record or used for deployment.

## Authenticated production smoke contract binding in 1.3.12

ANPOS 1.3.12 hardens the vendor-only production verifier so explicitly requested authenticated smoke checks cannot pass on route drift. Customer entitlement probes now require a positive GitHub account ID, send the canonical `X-Anpos-Account-Id` header, and accept HTTP 404 only when the JSON error is exactly `entitlement_not_found`. Operator verification is intentionally non-mutating: it authenticates `POST /api/v1/reconcile` with an empty JSON body and requires the route's exact `400 valid_account_id_required` contract, so a missing route, generic 400, unauthorized token, or stale API shape fails verification.

The commercial service package is 0.3.5 solely so exported `/api/version` attests ANPOS 1.3.12 exactly. No Marketplace purchase, reconciliation mutation, pricing decision, App registration, private-repository creation, production secret, or launch authority is created by this verifier hardening.


## AI-native assurance baseline in 1.4.0

ANPOS 1.4.0 promotes Requirements 83–96 into the active protocol. Product assurance covers AI/model evaluation, user/problem validation, outcome analytics, bounded experimentation, progressive delivery and engineering maintainability. Governance assurance adds responsible-AI/human-oversight policy, evidence-backed compliance mapping, durable architecture decisions, AI asset/configuration identity, compatibility/deprecation/EOL management, operational runbooks/resilience drills, tamper-evident audit evidence, and unified risk/exception lifecycle.

The canonical source remains an inert template. These controls become project evidence only after a child repository classifies applicability and records project-specific verified evidence. The 1.4.0 upgrade must not overwrite application code, approved architecture, legal/commercial terms, deployment behavior or previously verified child evidence.


## Blueprint closure baseline

ANPOS 1.4.0 defines the closed core blueprint baseline for Requirements 1–96.

- `config/protocol/blueprint-completion.json` maps every core requirement ID to authoritative documentation, machine controls and verification paths.
- `config/testing/reference-e2e-matrix.json` defines the three canonical repository acceptance scenarios: fresh child bootstrap, existing-repository adoption and pre-1.4.0 child upgrade.
- `config/protocol/extension-contract.json` reserves REQ-97 as the next normative core requirement and defines future extension namespace, compatibility, schema-evolution, migration and deprecation rules.

“Blueprint complete” means the reusable protocol/control/evidence contracts are defined and machine-validated. It does **not** claim that a specific child, runtime adapter, external deployment, Marketplace launch or future commercial tier has been implemented or certified.


## Repository Supervisor runtime implementation

The ANPOS 1.4.0 plugin blueprint now has a real first runtime slice in the vendor-only commercial service.

Implemented and source-certified:

- GitHub repository URL normalization and canonical resolution;
- authenticated GitHub account profile;
- exact default-branch head resolution;
- bounded immutable-ref control-file reads;
- ANPOS repository classification;
- Requirements 83–96 assurance/governance summary and exact-ref assurance reads;
- execution-sandbox request/driver contract with network denied by default, bounded time/output, environment names only, and no direct local-process fallback;
- commercial service 0.4.3 server-side Plugin Subscription Entitlement Bridge with authenticated GitHub principal/account binding, Marketplace reconciliation, organization-seat-aware paid read/write gating, and non-destructive cancellation boundaries;
- GitHub-backed OAuth 2.1 authorization-code + PKCE S256 source flow with protected-resource/authorization-server metadata, exact client/redirect/resource binding, one-time authorization-code replay protection, opaque short-lived MCP access tokens, encrypted server-side GitHub provider credentials, stateless POST `/mcp`, OpenAI-compatible authenticated profile metadata, and `/api/ready/mcp`;
- MCP OAuth CIMD hardening now verifies each exact allowlisted HTTPS client metadata document before authorization: redirect following is forbidden, fetch time/body are bounded, `client_id` and selected `redirect_uri` must match the document, and authorization-code/code/public-client `none` compatibility is required before GitHub OAuth begins;
- dedicated Repository Supervisor GitHub App role, separate from the read-only Marketplace billing/Community App and private Vendor Distribution App;
- commercial service 0.4.8 / Repository Supervisor plugin 0.8.1 principal-scoped billing-account discovery: authenticated users can list only their own billing account plus organization accounts backed by an active seat and current GitHub membership, with server-side read/write capability decisions and no global account enumeration;
- production billing-account discovery PostgreSQL ordering bug fixed: removed unnecessary DISTINCT from the seat-constrained query so live `repository_list_billing_accounts` can execute on PostgreSQL without weakening account scoping;
- commercial service 0.4.9 adds a temporary internal read-only Supervisor E2E grant with exact GitHub login binding, a maximum 48-hour expiry, no Marketplace purchase simulation, and full commercial readiness blocked while the grant is configured;
- commercial service 0.4.10 adds the Vercel-native signed sandbox gateway source at `/v1/execute`: Python 3.13 Firecracker microVM, deny-all networking, PostgreSQL nonce replay defense, exact-body request/response HMACs, exact artifact integrity/output allowlisting, explicit-empty live workspace mode, 240-second current execution budget, and mandatory workspace destruction before signed success; live gateway/write E2E evidence remains pending until deployment/configuration/probe evidence exists;
- protected sandbox live-probe hardening keeps the signing secret inside Vercel, resolves the function-to-function token through the pinned `@vercel/oidc` helper (with exact-origin validation before forwarding), and source-certifies a dedicated trusted-OIDC workflow that verifies runtime/network isolation, HMAC response integrity, exact artifacts, destruction evidence and durable replay rejection before live gateway evidence can be claimed;
- guarded write foundation: encrypted server-issued expected-head-bound `bounded_change` plans, atomic Git Data feature-branch commits, PR creation/re-read, exact commit CI inspection, destructive host-confirmed guarded merge, and resulting-main verification;
- commercial service 0.4.7 deterministic full Repository Supervisor planner for `bootstrap_empty`, `bootstrap_child`, `adopt_existing`, `repair_partial`, and `upgrade_active`, bound to verified private-template release Git identities and immutable target trees; target-only files and Requirements 83–96 project evidence are preserved;
- commercial service 0.4.7 sandbox-backed full-plan apply for conflict-free plans: non-empty targets use the exact expected-head feature-branch flow, while verified empty targets require explicit confirmation plus a deterministic zero-parent seed before the sandbox-verified feature branch; exact output paths/SHA-256 are verified, customer GitHub credentials are not forwarded to the gateway, and a persisted sandbox receipt is required;
- explicit full-plan conflict resolution derives a new immutable encrypted plan from one exact blocked source plan: every manual-merge/migration-review path requires an explicit `keep_target` or `use_release` decision bound to the observed target Git object, and migration-reviewed project-state replacement requires explicit acknowledgement;
- sandbox protocol v2 with signed bounded artifact staging/output, network deny, no host-process fallback, replay protection and workspace-destruction evidence;
- fail-closed production Repository Supervisor E2E verifier with separate `read`, `write_prepare`, and `write_verify_merge` phases and no CI busy-wait;
- vendor/operator launch bootstrap upgraded to the three-App trust model (Marketplace + Repository Supervisor + Vendor Distribution), signed sandbox environment handoff, and deterministic private service/template export verification so production activation cannot silently fall back to the public canonical source.

Production activation now also includes a source-certified guarded database migration controller. It runs only from explicit `ops/migrate-commercial-*` pushes, checks out canonical `main`, deterministically exports and verifies the exact commercial service, then deploys that exact export with a source-SHA-bound build flag. The committed `prebuild` hook is a default no-op; only an exact verified service export built by Vercel in the production environment can activate it. The hook requires `VERCEL_ENV=production`, matches the request SHA to `EXPORT-MANIFEST.json`, uses `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` when available (falling back to `DATABASE_URL`), runs the checksum-locked migrator twice to prove idempotency, and never retrieves the production database credential into GitHub Actions. The migration entrypoint itself is wrapped in an explicit `async main()` so the pinned `tsx` CommonJS execution path is portable in both source CI and Vercel production builds. It does not auto-migrate on ordinary source merges or ordinary production deploys.

Community remains restricted to the separate bounded readiness audit. The commercial bridge, MCP transport, guarded write runtime, sandbox driver and E2E harness do not alter or make subscription-dependent the ANPOS 1.4.0 Requirements 1–96 child development blueprint.

This is the **Repository Supervisor source runtime + full planner + explicit resolved-plan conflict flow + sandbox-backed full apply + guarded empty bootstrap + production E2E harness**, not evidence that the sandbox gateway or public plugin is deployed or that live GitHub read/write E2E has passed. Live sandbox/E2E receipts and GitLab parity remain subsequent milestones.
